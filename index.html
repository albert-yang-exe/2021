<h4> first blog? </h4>
<p>
It is saturday, the 2nd last day of april break and i just realized how little work i got done. I guess these blogs will be weekly, the wikipedia segment will be
daily hopefully as soon as I finish that part of the website. Epic pictures will be monthly I guess. I'm kind of scared my friends have this website
saved and can see my really important confidential thoughts (you know me the s tier celebrity). Hey buddy stop looking at my super interesting thoughts
 this is so 1984. I baked an apple crumble all by myself. It only kinda failed and it tasted heckin good???? big dub for me bossman. Going outside is nice
 i honestly should go outside more often. I'll write some more tommorow.
</p>

<h2><a id="05-17">2021-05-17</a></h2>
<h4> idk </h4>
<p>its fitting that it's been a month. I think all my friends forgot about this website because in all honesty so did I. I just need something to vent into without sounding like 
a whiny baby. I don't really have anybody to talk to about this or at least i'm too scared to talk to my parents or sister about it. I'm gonna name drop because 
nobody will be visiting this website but me.  a week ago arsham called me
 he was worried that something had happened to his family who hadn't come home in quite a while. While I knew this was an overreaction he seemed really upset
 and I just couldn't find the words. I really suck at these type of things.
 On october 2020 nicholas's mom passed away and he told me about it on a private discord call. 
nothing like this has really happened to me before and it really sucked because I was silent for most of the time. I couldn't find the words to say
or the i didn't know what i could do i felt really stupid. I try to console him but everytime i just mmmmmmm i just don't know how to 
comfort somebody. Recently my uncle got diagnosed with cancer. I haven't seen my mom cry in forever, infact this is maybe my only 2nd memory.
I'm not that close with my uncle, i don't really even speak his language too well but he i don't know. My mom cried at dinner recently
i didn't say anything i also didn't do anything. I just kept my head down and ate because that's all i knew how to do. I don't know how to make 
anybody feel better. I just kept eating until i started crying. and i tried to stop but i guess i'm just an easy cry-er. i don't know why i have to 
be so stupidly inept at these things. i feel so idk. Anyways future albert i hope ur better at helping people when ur reading this. if not that's ok
i have trouble with it too.
