<h2><a id="04-17">2021-04-17</a></h2>
<h4> first blog? </h4>
<p>
It is saturday, the 2nd last day of april break and i just realized how little work i got done. I guess these blogs will be weekly, the wikipedia segment will be
daily hopefully as soon as I finish that part of the website. Epic pictures will be monthly I guess. I'm kind of scared my friends have this website
saved and can see my really important confidential thoughts (you know me the s tier celebrity). Hey buddy stop looking at my super interesting thoughts
 this is so 1984. I baked an apple crumble all by myself. It only kinda failed and it tasted heckin good???? big dub for me bossman. Going outside is nice
 i honestly should go outside more often. I'll write some more tommorow.
</p>

<h2><a id="05-17">2021-05-17</a></h2>
<h4> idk </h4>
<p>its fitting that it's been a month. I think all my friends forgot about this website because in all honesty so did I. I just need something to vent into without sounding like 
a whiny baby. I don't really have anybody to talk to about this or at least i'm too scared to talk to my parents or sister about it. I'm gonna name drop because 
nobody will be visiting this website but me.  a week ago arsham called me
 he was worried that something had happened to his family who hadn't come home in quite a while. While I knew this was an overreaction he seemed really upset
 and I just couldn't find the words. I really suck at these type of things.
 On october 2020 nicholas's mom passed away and he told me about it on a private discord call. 
nothing like this has really happened to me before and it really sucked because I was silent for most of the time. I couldn't find the words to say
or the i didn't know what i could do i felt really stupid. I try to console him but everytime i just mmmmmmm i just don't know how to 
comfort somebody. Recently my uncle got diagnosed with cancer. I haven't seen my mom cry in forever, infact this is maybe my only 2nd memory.
I'm not that close with my uncle, i don't really even speak his language too well but he i don't know. My mom cried at dinner recently
i didn't say anything i also didn't do anything. I just kept my head down and ate because that's all i knew how to do. I don't know how to make 
anybody feel better. I just kept eating until i started crying. and i tried to stop but i guess i'm just an easy cry-er. i don't know why i have to 
be so stupidly inept at these things. i feel so idk. Anyways future albert i hope ur better at helping people when ur reading this. if not that's ok
i have trouble with it too.

</p>
<p>
my sister said i should message my cousin to see if he's okay. i don't know why i cry so easily.
</P>
<p> update: i am eating icecream and playing violin at 10 pm </p>

<h4> goals! </h4>
<p>
So the previous one was a bit of a downer. I think I'm all better now tho so time to tell you about the past month so far. Man i got into running to improve
my health and stuff but I ended up injuring my legs. My friends at wab didn't want to do the 100km CN Tower bike ride which bummed me out
the entire point of training was so i could the do bike ride but that's alright. I did pushups!!!! I don't actually look that much less skinnier
but now it's just easier to go outside with a t-shirt on or something. Idk i don't wanna be like super buff i just wanna look normal. It's nice
i feel like my self esteem has raised. I also realized how little I win. I'm gonna start training for AMC and Fryer and Hypalatia.

</p>

<h4> self awareness isn't an excuse but problems have to be addressed</h4>
<p>
my uncle is still in the hospital

    Most of the goals i had in the last blog have been pretty much forgotten about. Some pretty weird stuff has happened that I'm too scared to 
get into. I've been spending too much time infront of the computer that my eyes have gotten red. You can see the veins or whatever and if you
 look too close it looks pink. I just finished taking a shower and I didn't look too close because I didn't want to think about it. That's a lot
 of things right now I guess. I just feel kind of unhappy but not really with my surrounding but more with myself. I was thinking at dinner today
  that philosphers are just teenagers who never got out of their angsty phase. Even now I want to say that I'm just going through a phase as a 
  defence mechanism. Being self aware doesn't absolve your flaws which sucksss because if it did I'd be pretty much perfect. I think I've just made 
  so many mistakes in the past I can't really be sure about making decisions now without thinking my future self would cringe. I keep being upset 
  about the things around me, and I keep blaming the people around me (silently) but it's really all just to cope with my own mundane-ness. In 
  reality I'm pretty pathetic and I keep trying to grasp at these empty attempts to try to convince myself I'm not. I'm nothing special. Even worse
   I'm not even different. From now on I will be alloting 6+1 hours to studying. I gotta build some confidence in myself since right now I'm not feeling
   too good.
